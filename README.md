# TheMixer
Mixer is a universal development environment, decompiler, compiler, runtime, and language translation system. Its purpose is to bridge the gap between all programming languages, architectures, and platforms by offering a unified pipeline for writing, analyzing, and launching software â€” regardless of origin or format.

**MixerIDE**
MixerIDE is an experimental, modular IDE designed to :

  - Accept source code from *any* language (C, Python, GML, Assembly, etc.)
  - Decompile unknown binaries or executables
  - Translate all inputs down to a universal low-level representation (e.g., Assembly)
  - Recompile into desired output formats (`.mix`, `.exe`, `.dmg`, etc.)
  - Analyze and correct code using optional AI-based debugging
  - Launch programs natively across different architectures and systems

---- Key Concept ----

# 1 : Language-agnostic development

Mix doesn't prioritize a specific language. Projects may contain multiple language blocks simultaneously, for example:

StartOf[Python]:
  def greet():
    print("Python is here !")

StartOF[C++]:
  void greet() {
    std::cout << "C++ is here too !";
  }

# 2 : OverLapTable System GUI system

In the case where the used languages will both take a same GUI window, the OverLapTable command will serve as an organization between each StartOf from any language that will modify the GUI. It will do so thanks to layered GUI-
For example, the wanted languages are GML and Godot, which are repeated among the global Mix program, and will act over the GUI :

"""
  StartOf[GML]:
    button_main = button_create(100, 100, 150, 40, "Start Game");
    button_set_color(button_main, c_green);
  StartOf[Godot]:
    var background = ColorRect.new()
    background.color = Color(0.1, 0.1, 0.3)
    background.rect_min_size = Vector2(640, 480)
    add_child(background)

  StartOf[GML]:
    draw_text(50, 30, "Score: " + string(global.score));

  StartOf[Godot]:
    var label = Label.new()
    label.text = "Welcome to Mix Demo"
    label.rect_position = Vector2(200, 20)
    add_child(label)
"""

From that program, we can set the which StartOf[lang] goes on top of which, like this :
"""
OverLapTable: [
  from GML : StartOf(1), LayerSetting = Opacity(90), Priority = Top;
  from Godot : StartOf(1), LayerSetting = AlwaysBottom;
  from GML : StartOf(2), LayerSetting = Opacity(100);
  from Godot : StartOf(2), LayerSetting = Opacity(25);
]
"""

Keep in mind that 3D and 2D layering are two different things- 2D layers will always be on top of 3D layers.

# 3 : "Big Bang" method

This "Big Bang" method consists in taking a file from any source, and process them with the following steps : 
  - Decompile down to Assembly (compatible with file's original programming language ofc)
  - Analyze (by running)
  - Recompiling into an executable of a selected architecture, language, and/or device
(The file will get from small, high-layer programs to a CHUNKY file in Assembly, which is why it is called "Big Bang" method
# 4 : Executable deconstruction

Mix can accept compiled programs (or even game binaries, we'll see), then :
  - Detect the language or binary structure
  - Emulate/sandbox-run for analysis
  - Decompile + extract logic
  - Recompile into a modifiable .mix file, or native executale

# 5 : AI-Assisted Recovery (maybe)

While upper-layer-to-lower-layer (ULLL..? U3L..?) value/program demakes are feasible, the Lower-Layer-to-Upper-Layer (3LU..?) remakes are not feasible, unless done by hand, or a custom bridging module added to the target language.


****Note: This project is in its early R&D phase.****

**Planned dependencies:**

Python (main framework)

LLVM / Clang (compilation backend)

Custom Assembly handling modules

AI module (optional; e.g., local LLM, or prompt-based engine)

UI system (Tkinter, Qt, or SDL depending on performance needs
