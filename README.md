# MixIDE
MixIDE is an IDE that mixes (duh) known and supported programming languages, thanks to a Python-ish syntax. The main usage of this IDE is the StartOf code, which creates a program block in which you can include a program of any supported language. (This project is still under construction, README.md will be available for further details)
